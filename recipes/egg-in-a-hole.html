        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Egg in the hole makes a delicious breakfast! A runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons bacon grease</li>
            <li>1 slice bread</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt bacon grease in a nonstick pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Cut a 2-inch hole in the center of bread slice; place in the hot skillet and cook until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Flip bread and crack egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until egg is cooked and mostly firm; flip again and cook 1 minute more. Serve immediately.</li>
